# check for "New" in sentence, then don't take the next word as a lookup item in WikiPedia data

example: "England" found as a link, but sentence contained "New England"

# augment WikiPedia map data to inlude:

- US state names
- as a one-off, add "New England"

# change categries like "news_economy" to "<https:://knowledgebooks/schema/topics/news_economy>"
