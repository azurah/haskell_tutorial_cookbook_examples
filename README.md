# Examples for "Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook, Second Edition" by Mark Watson

![Haskell Logo](haskell.svg)

This repo contains the examples for my Haskell book:

[Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/haskell-cookbook)

Updated 6/12/2020 for stack resolver: lts-16.0

Updated 8/6/2019 for the second edition of my book

Note: 6/18/2020: install directions in Appendix A to optionally install **cabal-install** (with latest GHC 8.8.3) produces an error running:

        stack install cabal-install

Installing **cabal-install** is optional. Installing **stack** using the directions in Appendix A which refers you to th official documentation at [http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html is sufficient for running the exampes in my book.


## Tool Installation

See Appendix A in my book, or simply install **stack** and **hlint**.
